## THE CRANKY DEVELOPER'S MANIFESTO

(adapted from [The Cranky Developer Manifesto](https://dev.to/codemouse92/the-cranky-developer-manifesto--24km), which is © 2018-2019 Jason C. McDonald)

I am developing this project for the sole purpose of my own enjoyment.
I make no promises about release date, features, usability, stability,
practicality, or compliance with any normal standards of software
development.

In pursuit of my unhindered enjoyment of this project, the only end-user
I choose to care about in this project is myself, and maybe a few select
friends. The timeline, the features, and the implementation are all
solely at my discretion. I reserve the right to make arbitrary decisions, 
and change them at a moment's notice, without owing anyone an explanation.

If you see something here you like, you're welcome to fork the code UNDER
THE TERMS OF THE LICENSES.

If you're still intent on treating this as a viable project, you're welcome
to submit issues and pull requests. I may respond, or I may leave it sitting
indefinitely. If I ignore your bug report or brilliant contribution until
doomsday, don't take it personally.

If you decide to try and *use* this software, you're taking your sanity
into your own hands. As long as it runs on my machine, that is all I care
about. It may be unstable, or not support your system. I offer neither
warranty nor technical support.
